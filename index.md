## Hey Mommie! I love you,

 [Check out _WiFEHumas_Place!](https://thakasartu.github.io/huma/) There is some really healthy info in there about Googles Summer oF Code. Theres shit to do, you know i got that BMX_flow... Always working, even when cohabitation commences, I like being healthy productive... My background in DevOPs and DATACENTER_OPERATIONS on the side of my life in Jehovahs Witnesses and Surviving Erika, Muna, and WillieKellYJR left my ass wit a work ethic that I can only work healthily in the household... Corporate want yo asshole and my manager that fired me was doin it with his boss and took it out on me after he bought muna in prostitution. Im Dance411's DevOps/Web/Git_Engineer so im holding it down for our Selassie_House_Studio and what my Wife_Clan direct. Im ready for baby duty... We have to track her as closely as possible, you know Mashonga captures our children like a Teddy_Rosavelt_Era ##BiG_GAME_HUNTER.... Jackson got kidnapped, Coral and Cynthia are living some 90s rated-R movie Stand_BY_ME LOST_BOYS lifestyle and I dont want that for Freedom, How do we do better and not repeat blatant mistakes? ##ATTENTION_TO_DETAIL, but how do you detail orient yourself without being unpleasant... Some members of our household Like Ahshanti get hurt and I dont wanna be too critical, I worked with critical people so long, I dont wanna hurt you guys in ignorance. The American women are so sensitive in certain ways that Im understanding is normal because they have a completely different energetic flow growing up in North America, Similar to me  but once I got reunited with our Ethiopian family I lost a lot of my American culture becauseI started acting equivelent to SoCAL Jamaican, Somalian+NORTH_AMERICA... Some ppl say we harsh in the middle east, I just hope I dont hurt folk feelins and im scared. The lonelyness from yall kidnapping and prostitution make get way too in my head and its hard to enjoy the short slits of time we get to interact... Interact, now I know the pimps will punish me knowing more detail about how I get some fulfillment just passing by or sitting in the same train car

## When Does 'Yes' Not Mean 'Yes'?
In recent years, there's been a lot of media discussion regarding rape culture, the boundaries of consent, and ‚Äúno means no‚Äù ‚Äî so why is no one talking about sexual coercion? With California's recent adoption of the nation's first Yes Means Yes law ‚Äî which asserts that the absence of the word "no" does not constitute sexual consent ‚Äî we seem to finally be grasping the reasons why a person might not be able to say "no" to sex, even though they want to. But what about people who say "yes" to sex under duress? Why aren't we educating people about the times when "yes" might not actually mean "yes"?

## I Didn‚Äôt Say No ‚Äî But It Was Still Rape @bustle
‚ÄúYou OK?‚Äù A boy asks me in the middle of consensual sex. His hands are firm on my hips, his breathing ragged in my ear. I turn my head to the side, twist my mouth into a grimace. He‚Äôs having trouble getting off, he tells me. He‚Äôll finish soon, he promises. One quick thrust.

‚ÄúIt hurts,‚Äù I tell him.

‚ÄúYou want to stop?‚Äù He says without pausing. There's a slight annoyance in his voice when he continues, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm really close.‚Äù

I don‚Äôt remember the feel of this boy‚Äôs hands, I don‚Äôt remember his caresses or kisses, I don‚Äôt remember the words he said to me before we started having sex. I do remember his heaviness pressed against me, the way he pinned me down by the very act of what we we're doing; his erratic, persistent, insistent movements, his loud pleasure and my pain. I remember speaking this quiet, muffled answer: ‚ÄúKind of.‚Äù But it‚Äôs unclear ‚Äî I will remind myself later, for days, for weeks, for years ‚Äî what exactly I have said "kind of," to. It‚Äôs too noncommittal and it‚Äôs too late...[ReadMore](http://affirmativeconsent.com/how-do-you-ask-for-consent/?hvid=3vSWGR)

## Bustle::The Justice For Victims Act Is A Huge Step Forward
Sexual assault laws differ from state to state ‚Äî depending on where you live, you have anywhere between three years and your entire life to report a rape. In California, the statute of limitations for rape is 10 years, but that may change soon. On Thursday, Aug. 18, the State Assembly of California passed the Justice for Victims Act, a bill that could potentially overturn the statute of limitations for prosecuting rape and other felony sex crimes. The bill, however, still needs to move through the State Senate and be signed by the governor before being officially [enacted...]()
